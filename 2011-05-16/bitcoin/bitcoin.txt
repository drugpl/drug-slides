** The most dangerous open-source project - Bitcoin **
** @mlomnicki **

* P2P Virtual Currency / electronic cash system
* No central authority issues new money or tracks transactions
* No central authority controls the currency
* Bitcoins are generated by computers by solving hard math problems
* There is common thought that CPU time is for bitcoin what gold is (was) for dollar
* ...actually bitcoins have value because they are accepted as payment









































How can I get bitcoins?
* Buy on an exchange - https://mtgox.com, https://bitomat.pl
* Accept bitcoins as payment for goods or services
* Generate bitcoins on your box - join miners farm
* 1 bitcoin = 8.4$, 5.1â‚¬, 25 PLN























In general:
* user has a bitcoin address like 18VpTnjy3HmFWNXApZwGCx6tTcKPdiLzSq
* address may change for each transaction
* no bank or other middleman needed. Transactions are direct
* transactions are anonymous
* public-key cryptography is utilised
* "give me your public key so I can transfer you money"






















Who accepts bitcoins?
* BitCoinWebHost.com
* AutoVPS.net
* Link2Voip.com
* betco.in (Poker Room)
* BitBet.org (betting)
* a50.pl

https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Trade - over 200 traders who accept bitcoins






















Problems:
* is it legal?
* governments/banks/jews will squash it like they did with Liberty Dollars
* possible security flaws
* transactions are irreversible = no chargebacks
* Hard disk crash = money are lost
* Compromised system = money are lost
* rm -rf / = money are lost
* doesn't work offline
* only drug dealers, terrorists, etc need to be anonymous
